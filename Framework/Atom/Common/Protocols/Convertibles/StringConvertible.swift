/// The `StringConvertible` protocol declares an interface used for representing conforming type as a string.
///
/// `StringConvertible` protocol is defined and used despite having similar protocols available
/// in Standard Library (ex: `CustomStringConvertible`). This is intentional due to how these protocols
/// are defined and used. For example, documentation for `CustomStringConvertible` has this suggestion:
///
/// "Accessing a typeâ€™s description property directly or using `CustomStringConvertible` as a generic constraint is discouraged."
internal protocol StringConvertible {
    /// Returns conforming type as a **loosely** constructed string representation.
    var stringValue: String { get }
